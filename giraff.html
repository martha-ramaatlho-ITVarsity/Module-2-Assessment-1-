                    <h3>GIRAFFS</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals, 
                        the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Taxonomic 
                        classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based
                         upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological 
                         measurements of Giraffa, but the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
                         currently recognises only one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, the type species, 
                         with nine subspecies. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known 
                         from fossils.

                    </p>
                    <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and 
                        legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified
                         under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi.
                          Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south,
                           and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit 
                           savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody
                            plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other 
                            herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas 
                            and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their
                             offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may
                              gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through 
                              "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant 
                              males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for 
                              raising the young.

                    </p>
